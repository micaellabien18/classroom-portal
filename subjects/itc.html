		<h1>Introduction To Computing</h1>

		<br><h4>1.1 What is a computer?</h4>
		<p>According to Dictionary.com, a computer is “a programmable electronic device designed to accept data, perform prescribed 
		mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.”<br><br>

		Watch the video to get an idea of what a computer really is. Think about this question: Are we (human beings) computers?<br><br>

		Direct video URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCq8-xTH7jA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCq8-xTH7jA</a>  Video length: 5:09<br><br>

		A computer has four basic functions, these are input, process, output, and storage. Referring back to the question above, 
		human beings perform the four basic functions and therefore could possibly be categorized as a computer.<br><br>

		1. We have input in the form of our five senses.<br>
		2. Our brain has a memory component which stores important information and discards unnecessary items.<br>
		3. Our brain processes thoughts and ideas based on what is received from the five senses.<br>
		4. We send output via speech, body language, and facial expressions.<br><br>

		Honestly, why do we even need computers?</p><br>

		<h4>1.2 Hardware and Software Basics</h4>
		<p>There are two major components of a computer system. These are hardware and software. The hardware is the physical 
		components both inside the computer and outside the computer that mechanically operate the computer. The software is not a 
		physical item but is still very real and assists the hardware by providing instructions and commands to also assist in operations</p><br>

		<h5>Hardware Basics</h5>
		<p>Computer hardware consists of the physical components of a computer system. It includes components inside the computer and 
		outside the computer. The box containing the internal components of a basic desktop computer has many names such as chassis, tower,
		case, or system unit. This is the main external component of the computer which houses all the internal components. Internal components 
		inside the case include the central processing unit (CPU), the motherboard, and two different types of memory storage, 
		the power supply, and various expansion slots. Hardware components that are not necessarily required for the computer CPU to
		 operate are usually called peripherals which can include secondary storage and input and output devices.<p><br>

		<h6>Hardware External Components</h6>
		<p>Secondary storage can technically be an external or an internal hardware component of a computer. 
		There are a few different types of external secondary storage such as external hard drives and flash drives. 
		This type of storage is usually portable and allows a person to carry data with them to use in other computers as needed.<br><br>

		The list of input and output hardware components seems unending. An input device is used to provide data or instruction to a computer. 
		If a device is used to make the computer perform an action then it is considered an input device. A keyboard and a mouse or touchpad 
		were probably the most common forms of input until touchscreens became popular. Keyboards, mice, and touchpads are still used of 
		course, but only with stationary systems. Most mobile devices such as phones and tablets are now touchscreen. What are some other
		 devices that are a computer input component?<br><br>

		Output devices provide the results of the action that your input devices request. The most common output devices 
		are the monitor or screen and printers. For example, you could use the keyboard to type or input the math problem 
		5+6 into an on-screen calculator and the result of 11 displayed on the screen is the output. You can also go further 
		and send a command to the printer to print the result for an additional form of output. What are some other devices that are computer output devices?</p><br>

		<h6>Hardware Internal Components</h6>
		<p>The motherboard is the main internal hardware component which connects all the other components together. 
		The CPU resides on the motherboard and all circuits on the motherboard can be traced in some path back to 
		the CPU. The CPU is the brain of the computer and all commands are processed here which are directly obtained 
		from information residing in storage. The computer has internal storage in two categories, primary and secondary. 
		Recall the mention that secondary storage could be considered both internal and external. Internal secondary 
		storage is the computer’s internal hard drive and can also be a CD or DVD drive built in to the computer case. 
		The primary storage is the random-access memory (RAM) and is commonly just called the computer’s memory. The RAM 
		is the primary storage because it stores the information that is directly accessible by the CPU. The CPU fetches 
		commands from the RAM and processes them in a sequential order. Oftentimes these commands require action from other
		 internal components further down the line. Many of these components are in the form of cards which are contained in
		 expansion slots on the motherboard. These can include video cards, sound cards, network cards, and so on. For example,
		 many people who use their computers for online-gaming require increased video graphics and audio capabilities to make 
		 their gaming experience the best possible. Their computers will have higher capability video and sound cards inserted 
		 into the motherboard expansion slots to facilitate this optimal experience. Of course, none of these internal components 
		 can operate without a power source which is known as the power supply. Maybe the power supply is the most important 
		 internal component of all?</p><br>


		<h5>Software Basics</h5>
		<p>For hardware components to interact and perform, they require some sort of 
		software. Software is an intangible component meant to activate and control the 
		hardware and process input and output commands. There are two main types of software; 
		system software and application software. Application software makes life easier for the end-user of 
		a computer by allowing them to perform specific tasks such as sending an email or typing a letter. Examples 
		of application software include word processing and graphics design software. System software supports internal 
		computer function, manages hardware resources and provides a platform for application software to run upon. 
		Some examples of system software include operating systems, device drivers, and system utilities. The operating 
		system is of great importance and controls how signals move inside the box. In the next section we will cover how 
		data moves between separate boxes or computers: data communications.<br><br>

		<h4>1.3 Data Communications</h4>
		<p>According to Dictionary.com, data communications is the electronic transmission of information that has 
		been encoded for storage and processing by computers. The systems that carry the electronic transmission of 
		information are called networks. The largest and most well-known network is the Internet.<br><br>
