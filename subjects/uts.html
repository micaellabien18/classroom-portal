		<h1>Understanding The Self</h1>
		<h3>The Self from Various Philosophical Perspectives</h3>

		<h4>ABSTRACTION</h4>
		<h5>• Socrates and Plato</h5>
		<p>- Socrates was the first philosopher who ever engaged in a systematic questioning about the self; 
		the true task of the philosopher is to know oneself. <br>
		- For Socrates, every man is composed of body and soul; all individuals have an imperfect, 
		impermanent aspect to him, and the body, while maintaining that there is also a soul that is perfect and permanent.<br>
		- Plato supported the idea that man is a dual nature of body and soul.-Plato added that there 
		are three components of the soul: the rational soul, the spirited soul, and the appetitive soul.</p><br>

		<h5>• Augustine and Thomas Aquinas</h5>
		<p>- Augustine agreed that man is of a bifurcated nature; the body is bound to die on earth and 
		the soul is to anticipate living eternally in a realm of spiritual bliss in communion with God.<br>
		- The body can only thrive in the imperfect, physical reality that is the world, whereas the soul 
		can also stay after death in an eternal realm with the all-transcendent God.<br>
		- Aquinas said that indeed, man is composed of two parts: matter and form. Matter, or hylein Greek, 
		refers to the “common stuff that makes up everything in the universe.” Man’s body is part of this matter. 
		Form, on the other hand, or morphein Greek refers to the “essence of a substance or thing.”<br> 
		- To Aquinas the soul is what animates the body; it is what makes us humans. </p><br>

		<h5>• Rene Descartes</h5>
		<p>- Conceived of the human person as having a body and a mind<br>
		- The body is nothing else but a machine that is attached to the mind. The human person has it 
		but it is not what makes man a man. If at all, that is the mind.</p><br>

		<h5>• David Hume</h5>
		<p>- The self is not an entity over and beyond the physical body.<br>
		- Men can only attain knowledge by experiencing.<br>
		- Self, according to Hume, is simply “a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which 
		succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement.”</p><br>

		<h5>• Immanuel Kant</h5>
		<p>- Things that men perceive around them are not just randomly infused into the human person 
		without an organizing principle that regulates the relationship of all these impressions.<br>
		- There is necessarily a mind that organizes the impressions that men get from the external world.<br>
		- Time and space are ideas that one cannot find in the world, but is built in our minds; he calls these the apparatuses of the mind.<br>
		- The self is not just what gives one his personality; it is also the seat of knowledge acquisition for all human persons.</p><br>

		<h5>•Gilbert Ryle</h5> 
		<p>- Blatantly denying the concept of an internal, non-physical self; what truly matters is the 
		behavior that a person manifests in his day-to-day life. <br>
		- “Self” is not an entity one can locate and analyze but simply the convenient name that 
		people use to refer to all the behaviors that people make.</p><br>

		<h5>•Merleau-Ponty</h5>
		<p>- The mind and body are so intertwined that they cannot be separated from one another.<br>
		- One cannot find any experience that is not an embodied experience. All experience 
		is embodied; one’s body is his opening toward his existence to the world. <br>
		- The living body, his thoughts, emotions, and experiences are all one.</p><br>
