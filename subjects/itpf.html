		<h1>Introduction To Physical Fitness</h1>
		<h3>Physical Education </h3>
		<p><i>A subject where individuals can engage in physical activity of sufficient 
		quantity or quality to promote health benefits (Coalter, 2009).</i></p>

		<h3>Goals of Physical Education</h3> 
		<p><b> 1. Physical Education aims to develop your motor skills.</b><br>
		<b>Motor Skills</b> – refers to anything that allows you to move and use your body to expend energy and use it properly.<br>
		<b>Examples</b>: dancing, walking, & running<br><br>

		Physical Education will address your specific needs to improve on your movement patterns. 
		It is ultimately aimed to help develop the necessary motor skills that you need to fit any activity that requires you to move. <br><br>

		With poor motor skills, you won’t be able to move your body from one point to another. Having a poor set of 
		motor skills puts you at risk for experiencing injuries and a lifetime of health and other physical complications.<br><br>

		<b>2. Physical Education aims to hone your knowledge.</b><br>
		Just like all other subjects, Physical Education will require you to learn concepts, principles, and strategies. 
		These concepts would help increase your knowledge about physical activities, general fitness, and health.<br><br>

		Learning Physical Education is not only about relying on theories and general knowledge, 
		it entails you to use your <b>Applied Knowledge</b> in all aspects during this course.<br><br> 

		When your wisdom about Physical Education increases, the learning does not stop there. One of the beautiful things 
		that Physical Education offers is that it equips you to use the knowledge and concepts that you’ve learned in the 
		actual setting, when you are really exercising or doing physical activity.<br><br>  

		Moving and learning how to move properly are two different things, and in the same way that, exercise is different from a training routine.<br><br>

		Learning about these concepts and how to differentiate between them would then help you in the future when you want to develop your body for a specific type of activity/ies. <br><br> 

		<b>3. Physical Education aims to enhance your outlook about yourself.</b><br>
		Through constantly learning and having a strong foundation of physical fitness you will be able to perform daily tasks with grace and poise.<br><br>

		Physical Education directly affects your outlook about yourself---how you seemingly move your body in coordination through space. 
		Having that sense of confidence gives you the ability to believe in yourself more and the physical abilities that you possess.<br><br>   

		<b>4. Physical Education aims to develop and enhance your positive traits and attitudes.</b><br>  
		The long-term effects of Physical Education on individuals like you is that, your physique and overall 
		health will improve. When you look good, you feel good, and when you feel good, you tend to 
		look at the world on the positive side at all times.<br><br>  

		Having a healthy body, gives you a positive disposition about life and the dealings that you do on a daily basis. 
		Physical Education gives you the opportunity to develop this in yourself---to help you go about a healthy and active lifestyle. <br><br>

		<b>5. Physical Education equips you with the knowledge and skills to pursue a lifetime of physical activity.</b><br>   
		The most important goal of Physical Education is to help and guide you to pursue a lifetime of physical activity. 
		The lessons that you will learn from this course will inspire you to change your overall lifestyle choices and guide you 
		towards a more healthy and active lifestyle.<br><br>

		Pursuing a lifetime of physical activity is a choice that you have to constantly choose for yourself day-in and day-out. 
		Physical Education is an instrument that you can use to start this endeavor.</p>
