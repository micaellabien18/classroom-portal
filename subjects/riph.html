		<h1>Readings In Philippine History</h1>
		<h3>Meaning of History</h3>
		<p>As everyone knows, History is derived from the Greek word “historia” which means learning by  inquiry.  Aristotle,  
		the  Greek  Philosopher,  looked  upon  at  the  history  as  systematic accounting of a set of natural phenomena, that is, 
		taking into consideration the chronological arrangement  of  the  account.  This  explain  that  knowledge  is  derived  through  
		conducting  a process of scientific investigation of past events. <br><br>

		There are theories constructed by historians in investigating history: the factual history and speculative history. 
		Factual history presents readers the plain and basic information vis-à-vis the events that took place (what), 
		the time and date with which the events happened (when), the place with which the events took place (where), 
		and the people that were involved (who). Speculative history,  on  the  other  hand  goes  beyond  facts because  
		it  is  concerned  about  the reasons for which events happened (why), and the way they happened (how).</p><br>

		<h3>Sources of Historical Data</h3>  
		<p>As we go along on the discussion, let us now focus on the sources of historical data.<br><br>

		Historical data are source from artifacts that have been left by the past. These artifacts can either be relics or remains, 
		or the testimonies of  witnesses to the past. Therefore, historical sources are those materials from which the historians 
		construct meaning. The historian deals with  the  dynamic  (the  becoming)  as  well  as  the  static  (the  being)  and  
		aims  at  being interpretative  (explaining  why  and  how  things  happened  and  were  interrelated)  
		as  well  as descriptive  (telling  what  happened,  when  and  where,  and  who  took  part).  
		Besides,  such descriptive data as can be derived directly and immediately from surviving artifacts are only 
		small parts of the periods to which they belong.  <br><br>

		There are written and non- written sources of history. Let us explain each. 
		First, written sources of history are usually categorized in three ways: (1) narrative or literary, 
		(2) diplomatic or juridical, and (3) social documents.  <br><br>

		Narrative or literature are chronicles or tracts presented in narrative form, written to impart a message 
		whose motives for his or her compositions vary widely.  Examples:, biography, novel or film, and hagiography <br><br>

		Diplomatic  Sources  are  understood  to  be  those  which  document/  record  an  existing  legal situation or 
		create a replacement one, and it's these sorts of sources that professional historians once treated as the purest, 
		the “best” source. Example: Charter<br><br>

		Social  documents  are  information  concerning  economic,  social,  political,  or  judicial significance. 
		They are records kept by bureaucracies. <br>
		Examples: government reports such as municipal accounts, research findings, and documents like these 
		parliamentary procedures, civil registry records, property registers, and records of census.  <br><br>

		Second, unwritten sources - these are as essentials as written sources. There are two types: the fabric evidence and oral evidence.  <br><br>

		Material  evidence,  also  referred  to  as  archaeological  evidence  is  one  among  the  foremost important unwritten evidences.<br>
		Examples: pottery, jewelry, dwellings, graves, churches, roads, and others that tell a story about the past.  <br><br>

		Oral evidence is additionally a crucial source of data for historians. Examples of this are tale sagas of an 
		ancient peoples and the folk songs or popular rituals from the pre-modern period of the Philippine history.</p><br>

		<h3>Primary versus Secondary Sources  </h3>
		<p>It is very important to know the difference between primary and secondary sources. 
		These two concepts will help readers for better understanding of the past. <br><br>

		Primary  sources  are  original,  first  -hand  account  of  an  occasion  or  period  that  are  usually 
		written  or  made  during  or  on  the  brink  of  the  event  or  period.  These  sources  are  basically original and factual.<br> 
		Examples: Diaries, journals, letters, newspapers and magazines articles (factual  accounts), 
		government records, photographs, maps, postcards, posters, recorded or transcribed speeches <br><br> 

		Secondary sources are materials made by people long after the events. These sources provide valuable interpretations 
		of historical events. - interprets and scrutinizes primary sources. <br>
		Examples: biographies, histories, literary criticism </p><br>

		<h3>Historical Criticism</h3> 
		<p>Historical  Criticism  examines  the  origins  of  the  earliest  text  to  appreciate  the  underlying circumstance 
		upon which the text came to be (Soulen & Soulen, 2001). It has two important goals:  <br><br> 

		First, to discover the original meaning of the text in its primitive or historical context and literal sense.
		Second, to create a restoration of the historical situation of the author and receivers of the text.  <br><br>

		There are two parts to historical criticisms.  <br><br>

		1. External criticism determines the authenticity of the source. The authenticity of the fabric could also be tested in two ways, 
		by paleographical (the deciphering and dating of historical manuscripts) and diplomatic criticism 
		(critical analysis of historical paper to understand how the document came to be, the information transmitted, 
		and the relationships between the facts purported in the document and the reality). <br><br> 

		2. Internal criticism determines the historicity of the facts contained within the document. It is not  necessary  
		to  prove  the  authenticity  of  the  material  or  document.  However,  the  facts contained in the document must 
		first be tested before any conclusion pertaining to it can be admitted. In determining the worth of the facts, the 
		characters of the sources, the knowledge of the  author,  and  therefore  the  influences  prevalent  at  the  time  
		of  writing  must  be  carefully investigated.</p><br>

		<h3>The Birth of the Philippine History</h3>  
		<p>The history of the Philippines  (according to  H.O.  Beyer’s Migration Theory) is  believed to have taken off 
		with the arrival of the first humans using rafts or boats at least 67,000 years ago as the 2007 discovery of Callao 
		Man suggested. Negrito tribes first inhabited the isles and more groups later migrated to the 
		islands like the story of the Ten (10) Bornean Datus.   <br><br>

		Philippines  is  rich  in  history  however  the  written  record  started  with  the  coming  of  the Spaniards.  
		Many  believed  that  Spaniards  destroyed  the  earlier  records  as  completely  as possible.  The  same  scenario  
		happened  when  the  Philippines  was  under  the  American  and Japanese  colonization.  Many  precolonial  records  
		were  lost  and  were  no  longer  retrieved. Therefore, much of what is known about Pre- Spanish days are still insufficient. 
		There are still much to be uncovered. Other said that some of our recovered records came from other countries which  were  
		in  touch  with  the  islands.  Take  for  example,  Murillo-Velarde  Map.  It  was  a hydrographical and chorographical 
		chart of the Philippines Island drawn by the Jesuit Father Pedro Murillo Velarde (1696-1753) and published in Manila in 
		the year 1734. It was the first and believed to be the most important map of the maritime routes from Manila to Spain and 
		to those colony of Spanish Empire in the new world. The map contains captions, it also shows of great from the geographic 
		point of view, and as an ethnographic document.</p><br>

		<h3>History as Records of the Past</h3>  
		<p>The process of critically examining and analyzing the records and survivals of the past is very important in 
		order for us, readers to really understand history. Historians create their narratives through  a  survey  and  
		analysis  of  primary  sources  available  in  the  archives,  libraries or  the antique collections of document 
		enthusiasts. Relying on different materials and resources (both primary and secondary) will truly help us to bring 
		us back to the past events that may lead us for better understanding of the present.</p>
