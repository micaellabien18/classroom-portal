		<h1>National Service Training Program</h1>
		<h3>What is National Service Training Program?</h3>
		<p>The <b>National Service Training Program (NSTP)</b>, implemented by the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) in 2001
		 and established by virtue of the <b>Republic Act 9163</b> or otherwise known as the <b>National Service Training Program(NSTP)
		 Act of 2001</b>, is a compulsory 1-year course in the universities and colleges inthe country. In cooperation with the
		 Department of National Defense (DND) and the Technical Education Skills Development Authority (TESDA), the program was created. <br><br>
		 
		 The NSTP provides a policy framework on volunteerism that shall underscore the fundamental principles necessary to 
		 enhance and harmonize the broad and diverse efforts of the voluntary sector in the country into an integrative and effective 
		 partnership for local and national development as well as international cooperation and understanding. 
		 The program aims to provide a conducive, enabling environment for volunteers and volunteer service organizations by 
		 setting mechanisms to protect volunteers’ rights and privileges and give due recognition to highlight their roles 
		 and contributions to society.<br><br>
		 
		 In order to achieve the goals of the National Service Training Program Law, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR)
		 was continuously enhanced pursuant to Section 4. C. of the new Implementing Rules and Regulations on November 13, 2009,
		 the Minimum Standards for the Common and Specific Modules are hereby jointly issued, adopted and promulgated by the three major 
		 agencies, the CHEd, DND, andthe TESDA. <br><br>
		 
		 Article 1, Section 3 of the RA 9163 states:<br>
		 “It is a program that aims at enhancing consciousness and defense preparedness in the youth by developing the 
		 ethics of service and patriotism while undergoing training in any of its three (3) program components. Its various 
		 components are specially designed to enhance the youth’s active contribution to the general welfare.” <br><br>
		 
		 NSTP endows the students with theoretical and practical knowledge along with experiences that are needed for good 
		 citizenship and community service.It opens awindow for students to see the current situation of the community and the country. 
		 At the same time, it trains students to respond to the present challenges, enhancing the capability for national service.<br><br>
		 
		 The NSTP prepares you to take on the challenge by our national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal:<br>
		 “The youth is the hope of the motherland.”<br><br>
		 
		 Are you familiar with the song Kabataan para sa Kinabukasan by Francis Magalona? 
		 It beautifully depicts how promising the Filipino youth can be.<br>
		<i> “…gamitin ang talino, maging tunay na bayani, makabagong Pilipino Sulong kabataan, ipakita ang lakas, 
		 utunay at wagas na pag-asa ng bukas Nasa palad mo ang kapalaran”</i>
		  
		 Your role, therefore, in shaping the future of our nation is very relevant.
		 Even our 1987 constitution recognized this. Stated in Section 13, Article II:<br>
		 “The State recognizes the vital role of the youth in nationbuilding andshall promote and
		protect their physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual, andsocial well-being. It shall
		inculcate in the youth patriotism and nationalism,and encourage their involvement in public and civic affairs.”<br><br>

		See? It’s right there in our constitution - WE ARE valuable constituent of ourcountry. With all your 
		potential, idealism and energy, WE are capable of doing a lot ofthings for the good of others - to be of service to OUR nation.<br><br>

		WE can serve in a lot of ways. This is the concept that shaped the National Service 
		Training Program. This is what the program seeks to shape in YOU.<br><br>

		All Filipino students are mandated to take NSTP. That is why you and the rest ofyour classmates are 
		taking it. After all, everyone is a citizen of this country andeveryone should serve the country.</p>
