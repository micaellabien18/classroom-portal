		  <p><i>"Hi! My name is Micaella A. Bien, and I am a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student at Taguig City University. 
		  I have a nice personality and am very easy to get along with. What I like to do in my spare time is play instruments, bake, and just relax with my family. 
		  The thing I like to say about this website is that I really enjoy this entire development process, from design to completion. "</i><p>
